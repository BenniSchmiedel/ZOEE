Low-dimensional Energybalance models
************************************

Introduction
============

This project is a python-implementation of low-dimensional energy balance models (EBMs), built up from a set of physical functions, combined to represent the behaviour of earth's climate through space and time.
EBMs are one of the most basic climate models, able to reconstruct past climate conditions and predict future ones aswell. (some Examples)

The implementations of this project are based on a set of publications, especially from Michail Budyko () and William Sellers (). (For the full list see References).

This documentation primarily aims on explaining the structure of the sourcecode and show how to use it four your own purpose.
It is now the most well documented sourcecode, so if questions or concerns about implementations come up, please contact me (contact).
