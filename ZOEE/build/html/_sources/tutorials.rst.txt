Here given are tutorials/demonstrations of the EBMs listed below. 

All of them are supplemented within the installation directory under *~/lowEBMs/Tutorials/* or can otherwise be accessed from the git repository under 
https://github.com/BenniSchmiedel/Climate-Modelling/tree/master/lowEBMs/Tutorials.

.. contents:: EBM tutorial files:

For the physical background see :doc:`Model types <models>` and the explanation of usage see :doc:`How to use <howtouse>`. The explanation of additional functions and ther usage can be looked up in the :doc:`functions' definitions <code/functions>`. 

0D EBM (simple)
===============

A 0D EBM equiped with:

- constant incoming solar radiation flux

- outgoing radiation flux according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law


0D EBM (:math:`CO_2` forced)
============================

A 0D EBM equiped with:

- constant incoming solar radiation flux

- outgoing radiation flux according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law

- :math:`CO_2`-forcing according to radiative forcing estimates by :doc:`Myhre <references>`

The tutorial-file of this EBM uses a :math:`CO_2`-forcing based on 1958 - present atmospheric :math:`CO_2`-concentrations (the :ref:`Keeling-curve` :ref:`references:Keeling-curve>`)
