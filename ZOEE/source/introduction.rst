Low-dimensional Energy Balance Models
************************************

This project is a python-implementation of low-dimensional energy balance models (EBMs), built up from a set of physical functions, combined to represent the behaviour of earth's climate through space and time. The implementations of this project are mainly based on a set of publications, especially from :ref:`Michail Budyko <Budyko>` and :ref:`William Sellers <Sellers>`. (For the full list see :doc:`References <references>`)

The project was started as part of my bachelor thesis, **Benjamin Schmiedel (2019)**, at the **Institute of Environmental Physics, University of Heidelberg**, under the supervision of **Dr. Kira Rehfeld**, group leader of STACY_ (State and timescale-dependency of climate variability from the last Glacial to present day). 

Continuing work was carried out by :doc:`me <contact>` as scientific assistant, supervised by Dr. Kira Rehfeld, and as intern at the **Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen**, supervised by **Ingo Bethke**. Funding through the **Emmy Noether programme** of the German Research foundation and the european **Erasmus+ Program** is gratefully acknowledged.

Welcome to the lowEBMs documentation!
=====================================

This documentation primarily aims on explaining the structure of the sourcecode and show how to use it for your own purpose.
It is now the most well documented sourcecode, so if questions or concerns about implementations come up, please :doc:`contact <contact>` me.
